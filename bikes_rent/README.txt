Tasks:
1. Plot the number of trips by date and time
2. Transform the data and count the number of trips per day. Visualize the result
3. Use the daily aggregated data and calculate a moving average with a window of 3
4. Calculate the difference between the observed values and the values calculated using the moving average
Find the standard deviation
5. Determine the boundaries of the 99% confidence interval, add this information to the dataframe
6. Examine the abnormally high values and indicate the day when the number of rentals was the highest.
Find the cause of this anomaly
6. Examine the abnormally low values, find the day with the fewest rentals. Find the cause of this anomaly
